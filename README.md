# Learning C++ Concepts - A Journey of a New-Middle Learner

## Introduction

Welcome to my C++ learning journey! This README file is all about my experiences as a new-middle learner, exploring and mastering various concepts of the C++ programming language. Whether you're an aspiring programmer, an experienced developer, or simply curious about my journey, I hope this document provides you with some insights and inspiration.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to document my progress and growth as I learn new C++ concepts. As a new-middle learner, I have some experience with programming languages, but C++ is relatively new to me. I want to leverage this repository as a tool to track my achievements, challenges, and lessons learned while becoming proficient in C++.

## Learning Approach

My learning approach is centered around practical projects, hands-on coding, and continuous exploration. I believe in learning by doing, so I'll be working on real-world projects, coding exercises, and tutorials to grasp the fundamental and advanced aspects of C++.

I'll be tackling various topics, including:

- C++ syntax and fundamentals
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) in C++
- Data structures and algorithms in C++
- File I/O and streams
- Memory management and smart pointers
- C++ Standard Template Library (STL)
- Exception handling and error management


## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Projects**: This folder contains practical projects that I'll be working on as part of my learning journey. Each project folder will have its own README file, detailing the project's objectives and implementation details.

- **Tutorials**: In this folder, you'll find tutorials and code samples I follow to learn specific C++ concepts. I'll include references to the sources for further exploration.

- **Exercises**: Here, I'll solve coding exercises and challenges to practice the concepts I've learned. You're welcome to explore my solutions and provide feedback.

- **Notes**: As I learn, I'll be taking notes on important concepts, tips, and tricks. These notes will be available in the Notes folder for quick reference.

## Contributions

I'm open to feedback, suggestions, and contributions from the community. If you spot any issues with my code, have suggestions for improvements, or want to collaborate on a project, feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request. I believe in the power of collective learning and welcome everyone's input.

## Conclusion

Thank you for joining me on this journey of learning C++. I hope my experiences and the projects within this repository serve as a valuable resource for others embarking on their programming adventure. Together, let's embrace the challenges, celebrate the victories, and become proficient C++ developers.

Happy coding!
